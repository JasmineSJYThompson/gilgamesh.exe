Gilgamesh.exe

## üåü Project Overview

Project Name: Gilgamesh.exeTagline: A cyberpunk CYOA game on Polkadot‚Äîyour choices logged on-chain, your legend forged in blockchain-tracked history.

Description: Gilgamesh.exe is a choose-your-own-adventure game that reimagines the Epic of Gilgamesh in a gritty cyberpunk world. By leveraging blockchain, every player decision is recorded immutably on-chain. This ensures that each playthrough becomes a permanent, verifiable part of a shared narrative history. While full integration is in development, the game aims to let players own their progress and story outcomes, minting them as NFTs.

Integration with Polkadot: The game utilizes Polkadot's Asset Hub for NFT minting and plans to deploy smart contracts on a Polkadot-compatible EVM layer.

Team Interest: We are deeply interested in merging storytelling with Web3 infrastructure. By building on Polkadot, we aim to pioneer narrative permanence and interactivity in gaming.

### üîç Project Details

Technology stack:
- Frontend: HTML, JS, Python (CLI-based UI for prototype)
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (via Remix IDE)
- Blockchain Layer: Polkadot EVM-compatible parachain, Westend for testing
- NFT: Polkadot Asset Hub
- Development Tools: MetaMask, local HTTP server

**Core Components**:
- Decision Tracking Smart Contracts
- NFT minting via Asset Hub
- Decentralized save system
- Future: Immutable Story Graph

**Proof of Concept**:
- [Demo iteration 0 - Basic game loop](https://youtu.be/t5Ntn5ekXFA)
- [Iteration 2 - Value save via smart contract](https://youtu.be/egZqN9xHS_g)
- [Iteration 6 - Story tracker contract](https://youtu.be/y4dbvF7GeIE)
- [Loom code explanation](https://www.loom.com/share/209e56cbc8cb49988ec97b8b3ddc77cf?sid=d373e33d-da91-4e25-93fd-0c3bf428d90e)

**Limitations**:
- Full game isn't deployed yet
- Blockchain interaction currently faces latency issues
- Frontend and smart contract integration still modular and in-progress

**Will not provide**:
- Any form of complex trading besides providing NFTs
- Collating chain data and DeFi information
- Complete running on the Blockchain (this is potentially slow and unreliable) only saving of story progress and minting of NFTs

### üß© Ecosystem Fit
 
**Ecosystem Role**: Adds narrative permanence to Polkadot via on-chain story tracking and NFT rewards.

**Target Audience**:  
Gamers, Web3 users, story lovers, NFT collectors, and experimental devs.

**Needs Met**:
- Proof and preservation of player agency
- Portable, decentralized save states
- NFT collectibles tied to narrative outcomes

**Comparison**:
- No known Polkadot game logs every decision on-chain as a story graph.
- Unique in combining narrative-driven gameplay with smart contract interaction at a granular level.
